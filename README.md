# Crop-Prediction-Using-KNN-Classifier
This project aims at predicting the best crop to be grown in an area based on the historical weather and crops grown at that time.

We have used the supporting applications Automation Anywhere to perform robotic process automation, which is used to collect the current weather data for analysis and Alteryx for data cleansing and other tasks as described by an image in respective folder's readme files. 

Prediction of crop has been done using K Nearest Neighbors Classifier using python.
